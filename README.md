# Contentful Mux Next.js Starter

This is a starter template for building a blog with Next.js, Contentful, and Mux. It includes a Docker-based development workflow for a consistent development experience across teams.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed and running
- Git

No other local dependencies are required! Everything runs inside Docker containers.

## Development Workflow

### Initial Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd contentful-mux-nextjs-starter
   ```

2. Copy the environment file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.development
   ```

3. Update `.env.development` with your credentials:
   - `CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID`
   - `CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN`
   - `CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_ACCESS_TOKEN`
   - `MUX_TOKEN_ID`
   - `MUX_TOKEN_SECRET`

### Docker Development

Our Docker setup provides a consistent development environment with:

- 🔥 Hot-reloading for instant feedback
- 📦 Cached node_modules for faster builds
- 🛠️ Built-in debugging support
- 🔍 Health checks for reliability
- 👤 Secure non-root user setup

#### Docker Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run docker:start

# Build the application
npm run docker:build

# Run linting and type checking
npm run docker:check

# Stop the development server
npm run docker:down

# Clean up containers and volumes
npm run docker:clean

# Remove all Matic Docker resources
npm run docker:purge
```

#### Development Features

- **Hot Reloading**: Changes to your code will automatically trigger rebuilds
- **Container Management**: 
  - The container is named `Matic-Docker-App` for easy identification
  - Volumes are prefixed with `matic-docker-` for organization
- **Automatic Cleanup**: 
  - Pressing Ctrl+C during development automatically cleans up resources
  - `docker:check` automatically manages container lifecycle
- **Development Tools**:
  - Access container shell: `./scripts/dev shell`
  - View logs: `./scripts/dev logs`
  - Check status: `./scripts/dev status`

#### Best Practices

1. **Development Workflow**
   - Use `npm run docker:start` for daily development
   - Run `npm run docker:check` before committing changes
   - Keep the logs visible for debugging

2. **Resource Management**
   - Use `npm run docker:clean` to clean up after development
   - Use `npm run docker:purge` when switching branches or for deep cleaning

3. **Troubleshooting**
   - Check container status with `./scripts/dev status`
   - View logs with `./scripts/dev logs`
   - If in doubt, run `npm run docker:purge` and start fresh

### Non-Docker Development

If you prefer to develop without Docker, you'll need:
- Node.js (version specified in package.json)
- npm (version specified in package.json)

Then you can use these commands:
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build the application
npm run build

# Run linting and type checking
npm run check
```

## Feature Development Workflow

Our feature development workflow is designed to maintain high code quality and consistency across the team. Follow these guidelines for all feature development:

### 1. Branch Management

- **Branch Naming Convention**: 
  ```
  <type>/<ticket-number>-<brief-description>
  ```
  - Types: `feature`, `bugfix`, `hotfix`, `refactor`, `docs`
  - Example: `feature/MATIC-123-add-video-player`

- **Branch Lifecycle**:
  1. Create from latest `main`
  2. Regular commits during development
  3. Rebase with `main` before PR
  4. Delete after merge

### 2. Development Process

1. **Planning**:
   - Review ticket requirements
   - Break down into tasks
   - Identify affected components
   - Plan test coverage

2. **Local Development**:
   ```bash
   # Start fresh with a new branch
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/MATIC-XXX-description
   
   # Start development environment
   npm run docker:start
   ```

3. **Development Loop**:
   - Write code with hot-reloading
   - Run checks frequently:
     ```bash
     npm run docker:check
     ```
   - Commit logical chunks of work
   - Update tests and documentation

### 3. Code Quality Standards

- **Commit Messages**:
  ```
  <type>: <description>
  
  [optional body]
  [optional ticket reference]
  ```
  - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `style`, `test`, `chore`
  - Example: `feat: add video player component`

- **Pre-commit Checks**:
  - Linting (ESLint)
  - Type checking (TypeScript)
  - Code formatting (Prettier)
  - Unit tests (if applicable)

- **Code Style**:
  - Follow ESLint configuration
  - Use TypeScript strictly
  - Document complex logic
  - Keep components focused
  - Follow project structure

### 4. Pull Request Process

1. **Preparation**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure all changes are committed
   git status
   
   # Rebase with main
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git checkout your-branch
   git rebase main
   
   # Verify everything works
   npm run docker:purge  # Clean slate
   npm run docker:start  # Verify app works
   npm run docker:check  # Run all checks
   ```

2. **PR Creation**:
   - Use PR template
   - Link related tickets
   - Add screenshots/videos if UI changes
   - Tag relevant reviewers

3. **PR Description**:
   - Summarize changes
   - List testing steps
   - Note any breaking changes
   - Include deployment considerations

4. **Review Process**:
   - Address review comments
   - Keep PR updated with main
   - Get required approvals
   - Ensure all checks pass

### 5. Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Required for utilities and hooks
- **Integration Tests**: Required for complex features
- **UI Tests**: Required for critical user flows
- **Manual Testing**:
  - Test in development environment
  - Cross-browser testing if needed
  - Mobile responsiveness if applicable

### 6. Documentation

- Update README if needed
- Add inline documentation
- Update API documentation
- Document breaking changes
- Add usage examples

### 7. Deployment

1. **Staging**:
   - Automatic deployment on PR
   - Verify features in staging
   - Run smoke tests

2. **Production**:
   - Merge to main
   - Monitor deployment
   - Verify in production
   - Be ready to rollback

### 8. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Docker Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Clean slate approach
   npm run docker:purge
   docker system prune -af  # Be careful with this!
   npm run docker:start
   ```

2. **Development Issues**:
   - Check container logs: `./scripts/dev logs`
   - Verify environment variables
   - Clear node_modules: `npm run docker:clean`

3. **Build Issues**:
   - Verify dependencies
   - Check TypeScript errors
   - Review build logs

### 9. Best Practices

- Keep PRs focused and small
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Update tests with code changes
- Document complex logic
- Follow the single responsibility principle
- Use feature flags for big changes
- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor performance impacts

## Animation Decision Framework

When implementing animations in your components, ask these questions to determine the best approach:

1. **Is it a simple state transition?**
   - If yes → Use Tailwind animations
   - Examples: hover states, fade-ins, simple transitions

2. **Does it need user interaction?**
   - Basic interaction → Use Tailwind animations
   - Complex interaction (gestures, drag) → Use Framer Motion
   - Examples: 
     - Tailwind: hover effects, click feedback
     - Framer: drag and drop, pinch to zoom

3. **Does it need to respond to gestures?**
   - If yes → Use Framer Motion
   - Examples: swipe actions, pull to refresh

4. **Is it purely decorative?**
   - If yes → Use Tailwind animations
   - Examples: loading states, entrance animations

5. **Does it need to coordinate with other elements?**
   - If yes → Use Framer Motion
   - Examples: synchronized animations, staggered lists

See the animation examples in `src/app/template/page.tsx` for implementation details.
